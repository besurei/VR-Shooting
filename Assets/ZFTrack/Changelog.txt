(Version numbers: http://semver.org/)

3.0.0:

  Summary: Roll interpolates much better, track bender window, many new features.

  Features:
    - Added new curve type, CurveType.HermiteV2, which deals much, much
    better with sections than bend up or down more than 90Â°.
      - This is now the default curve type.
    - Track ties are now much more evenly spaced. (We now use approximated
      physical distance instead of a Hermite fraction.)
    - Added EndOfLineBehavior.EndStop, which causes carts reaching the end
    of the line to slam to a halt as if there was a wall.
    - Added a new "Track Bender" window filled with tools for bending
    track and quickly roughing track layout.
    - Static tracks now support lightmapping (in newest Unity versions).
    - Added a simple CharacterRidesCart (example) script to allow an FPS
      controller to get on the cart, look and control it, and get off again.
    - Added new cart parameter "curvePreservation" which preserves cart
      velocities better when going around curves, but may need to be
      tuned to keep the physics realistic.
      For now this defaults to 0 (old behavior), but may change in the
      future. A value of .5 - .7 is recommended for "frictionless" carts.
    - Added button in the inspector to select all connected track pieces
      at once.
    - Added events to Track (onCartEnter/onCartLeave) for when TrackCarts
      enter or leave a section.
    - Added WheelSpin script. Attach it to your cart's wheels to make them
      spin as the cart moves along track.
    - Sloped brakes set to a target speed of 0 will actually stop when the
      cart slows enough.
    - Added experimental support for tracks with rigidbodies.
    - Added elevator lift (cart riding track riding track) demo/example.
    - Mesh generation appears in the profiler.
    - Added new option to force end cap generation even when a track is
      linked.

  Changes:
    - Drop Unity 4.x support.
    - These defaults have been changed. Existing scenes should continue
      to use the old value.
      - TrackCart.clearingDistance now defaults to .5
      - CurveType.HermiteV2 is now the default curve type
    - Tracks with rigidbodies will now generate collision meshes. (They
      still complain if the collider is not marked convex.)
    - Some tools on the track inspector have been moved to or superseded
      by items in the Track Bender window.
    - Rearranged/normalized folder structure, demo is no longer buried in
      a .zip.
    - Removed the loop demo as building loops is much easier now.

  Fixes:
    - Carts with gravity disabled will no longer get magically pulled down
      by their invisible guide.
    - "Find and Snap to Track" for carts now correctly restores unlinked
      state on undo.
    - "Find and Snap to Track" doesn't snap to disabled Tracks anymore.
    - NearestPoint (& friends) with a distant position correctly return
      the start or end of a track section.
      - Fixes: "Find and Snap to Track" doesn't snap to non-nearest tracks
        anymore.
    - Fix logged (but harmless) error when merging tracks.
    - Editor: Snapping a track to nearest no longer snaps to disabled tracks.


2.0.0:

  Summary: Added sound support, improved cart tracking, more demos,
  fixes, improvements.

  This release contains breaking changes.

  Features:
    - Curve start and end points now have strengths, allowing better
      control over the curve.
      - When editing the start or end of a track piece, use the new purple
        ball to adjust the curve strength.
    - Added snap-cart-to-track button. Use it to align an assigned cart to
      its track or to assign a new cart to the nearest track and align it.
    - Add new demos for:
      - Creating a multi-car train.
      - Creating a touch control to switch track between nodes.
    - Added new TrackCartSound script for adding sounds to carts. See the
      readme under "Cart Sounds" for details.
    - Two carts with their sound set up are included in the Prefabs folder.
    - Examples of the other track profiles are included in the Prefabs
      folder. (You may have to re-assign textures if using Unity 4.)
    - TrackSwitcher can now switch the start of the track.
    - TrackSwitcher can be manually switched during play mode from the
      inspector.

  Changes:
    - CatmullRom and Linear curve types have been removed.
      - These cure types do not guarantee that the tangent of the curve
        matches the direction of the curve at the start and end points.
      - Hermite curves now allow you to control to strength of the curve
        at the beginning and end.
    - Existing Hermite curves should retain their shape, but may not be
      generated pixel-for-pixel the same as last release.
    - All track scripts were moved into a namespace. Add "using
      ZenFulcrum.Track;" to the top of any file using track APIs.
    - The field CartTrack.currentTrack has been replaced with the
      property CartTrack.CurrentTrack.
      - SwitchCurrentSectionTo is now deprecated, use
        track.CurrentTrack = x instead.


  Fixes:
    - Cart tracking has been overhauled.
      - Sharp corners and strangely shaped pieces should no longer explode
        or continue straight.
      - Strangely shaped pieces should no longer face a (notably different)
        different direction than the track section they are on.
      - Single pieces that loop should now work, provided they doesn't
        self-intersect (or nearly self-intersect) and aren't too cusp-like.
    - Limit the number of rail ties we will generate to something sane.
    - Remove some empty/unused bits.
    - Lots of spelling fixes.
    - TrackSwitcher doesn't force a switch on startup.
    - Added a warning in the Editor when you try to modify static geometry.
    - Added copyright header to C# files.
    - Acceleration on a TrackCart is determined correctly for stopped and
      very slow bodies, even when only reverse thrust is allowed.
    - TrackSwitcher won't get stuck between positions if switched away and
      back before a transition completes.
    - Other minor fixes.
